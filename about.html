      <h2>As a person I am.</h2>
      <p> • Very technical and creative.<br>
        • Always positive and humorous.<br>
        • flexible.<br>
        • Social.<br>
        • Responsible.<br>
        • independent.<br>
        • A team-player.<br>
        • Truthful. </p>
      <p>I am a healthy young man at the age of 26 who is ready to give it everything I got, work till we are done and lift every challenge to a higher level. I have always had a burning desire to work both with different designs and with defferent callanges. For that reason I have chosen to try my abilities as a multimedia-designer. I can work structured and I am not afraid to take up new tasks, big as small and working systematically and targeted till I reach the desired goal.</p>
      <p>My expereince:<br>
        2012-2017: I finished my education as an electrician in 2016. In this period I also worked as a professional DJ on the side. Before this I have worked as a handyman in a crafts company and as a shop assistant in a clothes shop. </p>
      <p>My language is Danish as a native language but I also speak fluent English. </p>
